        <p>Hello, I am Leon Lee a fledgling programmer who has just enrolled into Griffith University's Bachelor of Computer Science. I began my studies on the March of 2024. I plan to expand my horizons as a programmer as well as grow as an individual. I am a creative person who loves drawing, writing, and playing the drumkit. I am driven by curiosity, which allows me to transfer skills from different domains as I can identify connections more easily. This trait has helped me gain unique insights as well as providing me with strong foundations in problem solving.</p>
